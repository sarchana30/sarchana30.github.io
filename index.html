    <h3> MOTOR STAY </h3>
    <p>The Motor Stay project aims to simplify the process of finding and reserving parking spots for users.
The platform offers users a convenient and hassle -free way to search for available parking spots in their vicinity.
Users can book a parking spot for their vehicle through the platform. It allows users to pay for the parking spot on an hourly basis , which saves them time and effort compared to traditional parking methods .
Our project aims to address the issue of congested parking areas by offering a streamlined parking reservation and payment process</p>
